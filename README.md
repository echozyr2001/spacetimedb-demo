# Quickstart Chat (SpacetimeDB)

This is a quickstart chat application example built with [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com/). It includes a server module and a Rust client.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
*   [SpacetimeDB CLI](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/getting-started/installation)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you are getting this project from a git repository):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd quickstart-chat
    ```

2.  **Generate Module Bindings**:
    Before running the client, you need to generate Rust bindings for the server module.
    ```bash
    make generate
    ```
    Or manually:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p client/src/module_bindings
    spacetime generate --lang rust --out-dir client/src/module_bindings --project-path server
    ```

## Usage

The project includes a `Makefile` to simplify common operations.

*   **Start the SpacetimeDB Server**:
    ```bash
    make start_server
    ```
    Or manually:
    ```bash
    spacetime start
    ```

*   **Publish the Server Module**:
    ```bash
    make publish_module
    ```
    Or manually:
    ```bash
    spacetime publish --project-path server quickstart-chat
    ```
    *(Note: `quickstart-chat` is the database name here; you can change it as needed)*

*   **View Server Logs**:
    ```bash
    make view_logs
    ```
    Or manually:
    ```bash
    spacetime logs quickstart-chat
    ```

*   **Run the Client**:
    After the SpacetimeDB server is running and the module has been published, you can run the client:
    ```bash
    cargo run -p client
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `server/`: Contains the Rust code for the SpacetimeDB server module (`spacetime-module`).
    *   `src/lib.rs`: Main logic for the server module.
*   `client/`: Contains the code for the Rust client (`client`).
    *   `src/main.rs`: Entry point for the client application.
    *   `src/module_bindings/`: Rust code generated by `spacetime generate` for client-server module interaction.
*   `Makefile`: Contains convenient commands for building, running, and managing the project.
*   `Cargo.toml`: Configuration file for the Cargo workspace.
